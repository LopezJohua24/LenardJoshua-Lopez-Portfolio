Reflection

Making this portfolio was a good experience for me, but I also faced some challenges along the way. 
One of the hardest parts was making the design responsive. 
At first, the layout looked fine on a computer, but when I opened it on my phone, the elements didnâ€™t fit well. 
I solved this by using CSS media queries and adjusting the font sizes and images until everything looked better on smaller screens.

Another challenge was the navigation bar. I wanted it to be easy to use, especially on mobile, so I added a toggle menu with JavaScript. 
It took me a few tries to get it right, but in the end it worked smoothly. 
I also had a problem with my CSS being messy because I put everything in one file at first. 
To fix this, I organized the styles into different files for each section, which made the code cleaner and easier to manage.

If I improve my portfolio next, I would like to add a contact form with backend support so people can actually send me messages. 
I also want to include more projects with descriptions or case studies to better show what I can do. 
Another improvement would be optimizing the images so the website loads faster. 
Overall, this project helped me practice solving problems and taught me how to improve step by step.
